Learn about basic machine learning models via experimentation! Includes interactive code examples

## Purpose

This presentation touches on some of the core concepts of machine learning, and how one might start making their own models. It achieves this by exploring some of the complexity behind an MNIST Number identifier. 

## Usage

There are 2 ways to consume the content of this repository. 

One is to read the `slides.md` file directly. This markdown file has all the different slides in the presentation along with speaker notes marked by a `notes:` section. 

Alternatively you may open the presentation in a browser by opening the `index.html`. This will a open a slide deck, that you may be more familliar with. If you press `s` on the keyboard with these slides open, you will be presented with a new window containing speaker notes.
